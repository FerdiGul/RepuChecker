<b>Note:</b> on VT option you can see some notice about usage of api key: <br>
	The Public API is limited to 4 requests per minute.<br>
	The Public API must not be used in commercial products or services.<br>
	The Private API returns <br>
	threat data and exposes more endpoints.<br>

<b>But you can send random http headers and api keys to pass it :). But if you wanna use your premium api key, yes just add your api key in this section:</b><br>

def checkDomain_VT(urlist):

	api = ['   <api key is here>   ']<br>

For now, only these engines were added on tool Iâ€™ve listed as you can see below:<br>

McAfee (trustedsource.org | McAfee Web Gateway v7.x/6.9.x (Resident)), <br>
VirusTotal (https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url),<br>
AbuseIpDB (abuseipdb.com)<br>
So, what can we perform via engines or dbs ?:<br>

In All of engines or dbs listed options, cheackable only single url/ip or more than one urls/ips.
