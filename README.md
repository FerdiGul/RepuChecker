You have an idea about project? Contact me : @0xfrd1

Note: Details of project are on my blog: https://ferdigul.com/repuchecker-v1tool

RepuChecker Tool help you to check URL/IP reputation on some platform such as security engines and ip database..

For now, only these engines I've listed as you can see below:

McAfee ( https://www.trustedsource.org/ | McAfee Web Gateway v7.x/6.9.x (Resident) ),
VirusTotal ( https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url ),
AbuseIpDB ( https://www.abuseipdb.com/ ),

So, what can we perform via engines or dbs ?:

In All of engines or dbs listed options, cheackable only single url/ip or one more than one urls or ips.Â

Note: on VT option you can see some notice about usage of api key: 
	The Public API is limited to 4 requests per minute.
	The Public API must not be used in commercial products or services.
	The Private API returns more threat data and exposes more endpoints.
	The Private API is governed by an SLA that guarantees readiness of data.
But you can send random http headers and api keys for pass it :). But if you want to use your premium api key, yes only you can add your api key in this section:

def checkDomain_VT(urlist):

	api = ['   <api key is here>   ']
